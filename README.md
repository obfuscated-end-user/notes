# Notes
Not really what you would call "notes", in a general sense.  
Contains code written for uhh, you know.  
Separated by year. (1 for first, 2 for second, etc.)  

It cost me a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, to produce repetitive, boilerplate garbage not worth looking into.

## Help?
Always remember that you're not limited on what your university provides you. You're free to look around on even the darkest corners of the Internet, just make sure that it's reliable though.  
Don't be afraid to read giant walls of text, and stop kissing ChatGPT's ass, or any kind of AI-related service that's out there. Use it sparingly, excessive usage will only make you more dependent on it.

I personally use these when programming:
* [Google](https://www.google.com).
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) for general information. Yes, quit the crap on this being "unreliable". Your teachers are mostly referring that you shouldn't use Wikipedia's articles as references, not that it's unreliable.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for programming-related questions.
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) for watching programming-related videos if you hate reading.
* [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) for viewing dead links.
* Documentation site for your target language, like [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com) for C++, [the official Python docs](https://docs.python.org), and many more. It may be overwhelming at first (who doesn't?), but yeah.

***TBD**. Will continue to add more crap in the near future.*
