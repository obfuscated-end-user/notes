Remove the boiled pork belly from the cooking pot and place in a plate. Let it cool to room temperature.<br>4. Rub the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of salt all over the boiled pork belly. Let is stay for 10 to 20 minutes.<br>5. Heat the cooking oil in a deep cooking pot. When the oil gets hot, gently put-in the pork belly and deep-fry in medium heat until the pork belly turns golden brown and the texture gets crispy. The oil will splatter during this process, so be careful. Make sure that you do not cover the cooking pot completely while deep frying. You can put a splatter guard on top of the cooking pot to control the oil.<br>6. Once the pork belly is golden brown and crispy, remove it from the cooking pot and arrange in a plate lined with paper towel. Turn the stove off and let the pork belly cool down to room temperature.<br>7. When the pork belly cools down, heat-up the oil on more time. Deep fry the same pork belly for the second time in medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes or until it gets extra crispy.<br>8. Remove from the cooking pot and place in a plate lined with paper towel. Let the towel absorb the excess oil.<br>9. Slice the pork bagnet into serving pieces and serve with bagoong monamon (also known as bugguong munamon) or even guinamos or bagoong Balayan. Note: you can squeeze lemon or calamansi on the bagoong to make it taste better.<br><br><a href='https://panlasangpinoy.com/bagnet-recipe/'>Source</a></div>","balut":"<div class='ingredients'><h3>Ingredients</h3><br>Eight thick-shelled eggs<br>1 cup palay rice (unhusked rice)</div><br><div class='instructions'><h3>Instructions</h3><br>1. Select duck or chicken eggs by tapping the eggs with your fingers to pull out cracked or thin-shelled eggs (Eggs with cracks have a hollow sound while thin-shelled have a brittle sound).<br>2. Only eggs with thick shells are used to make balut because they can resist the strain of being placed and removed from cylindrical baskets known as “toong.” This measure is 34 inches high by 21 inches in diameter and is open on both ends, and rice hulls are placed in the surrounding gaps to a height of 4 inches from the brim. Balut should ideally be created using eggs no more than five days old.<br>3. Roast or heat palay to a temperature of 107 °F or 430 °C in an iron vat or cauldron. Remove the palay when you can hold it in your hands.<br>4. Eggs are then placed in the toong, alternating with heated palay bags. The number of wild palay bags is 1 for every egg bag. Put two heated palay bags on the bottom and two on the top to ensure heat conservation. For every toong containing ten layers of eggs, you would need 13 bags of roasted palay.<br>5. Each toong can hold ten bags. Cover with just sacks to conserve heat further. Candling is the process of having eggs against the hole of a lighted box in a dark room to separate infertile eggs from fertile ones. Infertile eggs are called penny; these are also boiled like balut but fetch a lower price.<br><br><a href='https://cullyskitchen.com/how-to-cook-balut'>Source</a></div>","bibimbap":"<div class='ingredients'><h3>Ingredients</h3><br>3/4 cup short-grain brown or white rice, rinsed (soaking for 12-24 hours to speed cooking is optional*)<br>1 ½ cups water (if rice was soaked, reduce water by about 1/4 cup (60 ml) as recipe is written)<br>1 pinch sea salt<br>2-3 Tbsp sesame oil, DIVIDED (toasted for more flavor, untoasted works, too*)<br>3 cups packed mixed vegetables (such as finely shredded carrot, thinly sliced zucchini, or spinach)<br>1 heaping cup bean sprouts (if you can't find, sub more mixed vegetables)<br>2 stalks green onion, sliced on an angle<br>2 cloves garlic, minced<br>2 Tbsp coconut aminos, DIVIDED (or sub tamari to taste, or sea salt)<br>2 large eggs* (we recommend organic, pasture-raised, and as ethically sourced as possible, such as Vital Farms)</div><br><div class='instructions'><h3>Instructions</h3><br>1. Optional: If soaking rice, rinse, drain, and add to a mixing bowl and cover with cool water. Soak for 12 hours or overnight. For a quicker soak, cover in hot water for 1 hour. Then rinse and drain.<br>2. To a medium saucepan, add cooking water (if you soaked your rice, start with 1 ¼ cups water as recipe is written), rinsed rice, and salt. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender and fluffy. Soaked rice generally takes less time to cook. Unsoaked rice can take up to 30 minutes or more. Keep covered and set aside.<br>3. In the meantime, prepare Gochujang sauce. Skip if using store-bought.<br>4. While the rice finishes cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat (stainless steel or cast iron are best). Once hot, add 1 tsp of sesame oil or enough to just coat the pan.<br>5. Once the oil is hot, add vegetables one type at a time and cook in batches until lightly browned (1-2 minutes), seasoning each with a little minced garlic and a dash of coconut aminos, tamari, or sea salt. Cooking in batches allows you to arrange vegetables separately over the rice for visual effect. We cooked the zucchini first, then carrots, green onion, bean sprouts, and spinach. Add more oil to the pan as needed between vegetables.<br>6. Arrange cooked vegetables in individual piles on a serving plate and cover gently to keep warm until serving.<br>7. To cook eggs (if vegan, see notes for options!), heat the same pan over medium heat. Once hot, add a little more oil (sesame or otherwise), and carefully crack eggs. For sunny-side up (our preference), cover briefly with a lid to steam for 1 minute, then remove lid and continue cooking until whites are cooked but yolks are still runny. Turn off heat and set aside (uncovered).<br>8. To serve, divide desired amount of rice between serving bowls (see notes for traditional dolsot recommendations and crispy rice hacks!) and top with portions of cooked veggies and egg.<br>9. Serve with 1-2 Tbsp Gochujang, kimchi (optional), and a dash of sesame seeds (optional). Bibimbap means “mixed rice,” so once your egg and Gochujang sauce are added, use a spoon or your chopsticks to stir everything together and mix the flavors. Then enjoy!<br>10. This dish is best fresh, but leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator up to 2 days and be reheated on the stovetop over medium heat as a stir fry.

In a flat surface flatten each of the dough and roll using a rolling pin until wide enough to fit an eight or nine inch cake pan. Note: Sprinkle flour over the flat surface to prevent the dough from sticking or use a silicon mat. Arrange the first dough over the cake pan. This will be the base. Set the second flattened dough aside. This will be needed after arranging the filling in the cake pan.<br>2. Make the filling by heating a saucepan and pour-in the milk. Let boil.<br>3.

If you've chosen to make fluffier waffles, whisk the egg white to soft peaks, then gently fold this into the batter.
