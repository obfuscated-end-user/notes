    # The implementation of Conway's Game of Life utilizes the multiprocessing library to
    # enhance performance through parallel programming. By creating a pool of worker processes,
    # the program can concurrently compute the next state of each cell in the grid, as these
    # calculations are independent. The map method applies the updateCell function to each
    # cell's coordinates, distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores, which significantly
    # reduces computation time, especially for larger grids. While this approach improves efficiency,
    # it also introduces some overhead and increased memory usage, necessitating careful management
    # of resources. Overall, parallel programming allows for faster updates and a more responsive simulation.
